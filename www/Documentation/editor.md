#Editor
The Scaffold Editor has three parts: **File Explorer**, **Build**, and **Preview**. 
##File Explorer
The **File Explorer** displays what is in the `configFiles` directory via the **Filesystem** section, and any files can be previewed in the **File preview** window.

Under **Choose a directory**, any chosen directory can be *edited*, *forked*, or *removed*. You also have the option to create a new directory.

If for some reason your browser crashed while you were in the middle of an session, or you have unsaved changes, you have the ability to edit those sessions or remove them from memory, as shown by **Previously Unsaved Sessions** on the bottom right corner. The sessions are saved to **localStorage**, which means that if you clear your browser history or edit in an incognito window, then your unsaved data will not show up.
##Build
##Preview
You can preview your work in the dimensions of either a *laptop*, *tablet*, or *phone*, or you can customize the layout. You also have the option to preview it in a new window.
